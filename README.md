I am planning for this app to have separate views.
CRX will be the main/default view and be used for the CMS function of the app.
There will also be the integration of a social-media-like feature that will be hosted on the same domain but will present a visuals and feels separate from the CMS.

The User app is already working but needs to be re-worked. Models need further scrutiny as to what attributes will be added and/or removed.
Will also need to have a separate "base" page with a separate navbar and footer for its containerized features focused on the SocMed.
Still trying to generate more ideas and come-up with ways on how to have them implemented thru code.
